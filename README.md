# Java Code Corner ğŸ–¤

Hey! I'm Joo, and this is a small web project I created to keep all the Java programs I practiced during my learning phase.

Just 10-15 basic but important programs â€” stuff that helps build logic and confidence.  
Nothing over the top. Just simple, clean, and working code with a good UI.
